    <h1>Don't Get Me Wrong</h1>
    <p>by The Pretenders</p>

    <p>Don't get me wrong
        If I'm looking kind of dazzled
        I see neon lights
        Whenever you walk by</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong
        If you say hello and I take a ride
        Upon a sea where the mystic moon
        Is playing havoc with the tide
        Don't get me wrong</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong
        If I'm acting so distracted
        I'm thinking about the fireworks
        That go off when you smile</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong
        If I split like light diffracted
        I'm only off to wander
        Across a moonlit mile</p>
    <p>Once in a while
        Two people meet
        Seemingly for no reason
        They just pass on the street
        Suddenly, thundershowers everywhere
        Who can explain the thunder and rain?
        But there's something in the air</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong
        If I come and go like fashion
        I might be great tomorrow
        But hopeless yesterday</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong
        If I fall in the mode of fashion
        It might be unbelievable
        But let's not say so long
        It might just be fantastic
        Don't get me wrong</p>
