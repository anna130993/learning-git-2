    <h1><em>Don't Get Me Wrong</em></h1>
    <p>by <strong>The Pretenders</strong></p>

    <p>Don't get me wrong <br>
        If I'm looking kind of dazzled <br>
        I see neon lights <br>
        Whenever you walk by</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong <br>
        If you say hello and I take a ride <br>
        Upon a sea where the mystic moon <br>
        Is playing havoc with the tide <br>
        Don't get me wrong</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong <br>
        If I'm acting so distracted <br>
        I'm thinking about the fireworks <br>
        That go off when you smile</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong <br>
        If I split like light diffracted <br>
        I'm only off to wander <br>
        Across a moonlit mile</p>
    <p>Once in a while <br>
        Two people meet <br>
        Seemingly for no reason <br>
        They just pass on the street <br>
        Suddenly, thundershowers everywhere <br>
        Who can explain the thunder and rain? <br>
        But there's something in the air</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong <br>
        If I come and go like fashion <br>
        I might be great tomorrow <br>
        But hopeless yesterday</p>
    <p>Don't get me wrong <br>
        If I fall in the mode of fashion <br>
        It might be unbelievable <br>
        But let's not say so long <br>
        It might just be fantastic <br>
        Don't get me wrong</p>
